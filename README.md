## Whisper_model.py
This file creates a Streamlit web application that allows you to "chat" with an audio file. It first transcribes the audio (either uploaded or recorded live) into text using the Whisper model. It then uses this transcript to create a searchable vector store. You can ask questions in text or with your voice, and the application uses a Gemini language model to find and generate answers based on the audio's content. The app can also translate the transcript and the final answers into different languages.
## langchain_chatbot.py
This is a Streamlit application for a multi-user PDF chatbot. It allows different users to upload their own PDF files. The application processes each PDF and stores its content in a Neo4j graph database, keeping each user's data separate. When a user asks a question, the chatbot retrieves relevant information only from their specific PDF and uses the Gemini model to generate an answer.
## langgraph_rag.py
This is a command-line chatbot that uses LangGraph to create a structured agent. The agent is designed to answer questions based only on the content of a specific PDF file (forest_eng.pdf). It loads the PDF, creates an in-memory vector store, and uses a "retriever tool" to search for information. The agent is strictly programmed to not use any outside knowledge and will state if it cannot find the answer within the document.
## code_convert.py
This is a command-line chatbot that uses LangGraph to create a structured agent. The agent is designed to answer questions based only on the content of a specific PDF file (forest_eng.pdf). It loads the PDF, creates an in-memory vector store, and uses a "retriever tool" to search for information. The agent is strictly programmed to not use any outside knowledge and will state if it cannot find the answer within the document.
## lanngraph_QA_chatbot.py
This is a sophisticated command-line Q&A system that processes a PDF containing both text and images. It uses a LangGraph pipeline to first extract text and images separately. It then performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the images to extract any text they contain. All the text (from the document and from the images) is combined and indexed. You can then ask questions, and the system will retrieve information from both the text and the images to provide a comprehensive answer using the Gemini model.
## chat_with_llm.py
This is a Streamlit application that functions as a simple PDF chatbot with a user login system. After logging in, a user can upload a PDF. The application processes the PDF, creates a FAISS vector index for fast searching, and saves it to disk. The user can then ask questions about the PDF's content. The app finds the most relevant parts of the document and uses the Gemini model to generate an answer.
## pdfs_routerchain.py
This is an advanced Streamlit chatbot that can answer questions from multiple sources. It automatically generates a library of PDF files on various selected (nature) topics. When you ask a question, it uses a "RouterChain" to intelligently decide where to find the answer: from the specific content of the PDFs, from a pre-generated summary of the documents, or from the conversation's history. It also supports voice input for asking questions.
